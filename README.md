## Course Overview

This course provides a rigorous introduction to modern causal inference methods using the potential outcomes framework. Topics include:

1. **Potential Outcomes and Randomization** - Rubin causal model, RCTs, design considerations
2. **Instrumental Variables** - LATE, exclusion restriction, weak instruments
3. **Difference-in-Differences** - Parallel trends, event studies, staggered adoption
4. **Regression Discontinuity Design** - Sharp/fuzzy RDD, bandwidth selection, validity tests
5. **Empirical Tools** - Standard errors, multiple testing, heterogeneous effects

## Software

Problem sets can be completed using Stata, R, or Python. Recommended packages:

- **Stata**: `rdrobust`, `did`, `eventstudyinteract`
- **R**: `rdrobust`, `did`, `fixest`, `HonestDiD`
- **Python**: `rdrobust`, `linearmodels`

## Academic Integrity

You may use AI assistants to help with problem sets, particularly for debugging code. However, the final exam is closed-book and worth 80% of your grade. Use AI in ways that deepen your understanding.
